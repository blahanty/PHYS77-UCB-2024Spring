    "# Problem 1: Prime Number\n",
    "\n",
    "A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. In other words, a prime number is a number that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. For example, under 10, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are prime numbers; while 4, 6, 8, and 9 are not prime numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: Write a function to determine if a natural number is an integer\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**\n",
    "1. This function (`is_prime`)  takes two input arguments, N and verbose. N is the natural number to test, and verbose is a Boolean variable to control if any printout is made while executing the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The returning variable is Boolean. It indicates if the number under test is a prime number of not. True means it is a prime number, while False means it is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. When the input argument verbose is True. The function should print out the following message(s): \n",
    "    - If the nubmer is not a prime one, then you must have found at least one way to factorize the number. As such, you can include this line in your code:\n",
    "                   ` print(f\"{N} is not prime as it can be expressed as {M} * {K}.\")`\n",
    "    This line allows you to properly display the values of integers N, M, and K. For example, `451 is not prime as it can be expressed as 41 * 11.`\n",
    "    - If the number is a prime number, then your function should print something like 3 is a prime number by including a line like  `print(f'{N} is a prime number')`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. This function should not use any modules such as math, numpy, etc.. Simply go over all possible natural numbers smaller than the number to test, e.g., for 5, just check if 5%M == 0, where M could be 1, 2, 3, or 4. This requires you implement a loop structure in the function. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use your function to check if the following numbers are prime:\n",
    "    - 3431, 3533, 3534319, 3534313\n",
    "    - you should turn verbose to True for these tests\n",
